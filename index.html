    <tr><th>SECTION 1: UNDERSTANDING PERSONALITY TYPES AT WORK - COURSE INTRODUCTION</th></tr>
    <tr><th>Introduction to Understanding Personality Types at Work</th></tr>
    <tr><td>Knowing more about your unique personality can help you understand yourself better and make changes in your life that will make you more confident and successful.
        <br><br><b>Personality Types</b> are really useful to help people understand themselves at a deeper level, to help them with their relationships, and to help with career decisions.
        <br><br>Gives insights into communication skills, decision making, stress management, conflict resolution, and a whole host of other applications, so they really underpin the development of emotional intelligence.
        <br><br><b>Carl Jung</b> investigated Personality Types about 200 years ago, although his work was rather academic.
        <br><br>A mother-daughter team <b>Isabel Briggs Myers and Katharine Cook Briggs</b> worked with his research, further refined it, and made it a whole lot more accessible for everyone.
        <br><br><b>Personality Type assessment</b> is based on their work and is now used throughout the world in many corporate organizations to help with leadership development and many of the other aspects.
        <br><br><br><b>Myers-Brigss Type Indicator (MBTI)</b> - we explore where people get their energy from, how people take in information, how they use this information to make decisions, and then how people work with this to structure and lead their lives
        <br><br><b>4 Preferences</b> - combination of these makes up your personality type (each type has its own strengths and limitations)
        <br><br><img src="preferences.png" alt="Four Preferences">
        <br><br>Understanding how the preferences are expressed will give you insights into how your own strengths and limitations, and those of other people work. This will help you to understand how to engage with people better.

    <tr><th>Activity Booklet: Reflecting about this Personality Course</th></tr>
    <tr><td>Understanding more about personality will help you to predict how people will respond to certain situations and the sorts of things they prefer and value.
        <br><br>Understanding your personality and yourself better will help you gain greater insights into your behaviour and your emotional well-beings.
        <br><br>Your personality is what makes you who you are. It is often thought of as something that arises from within the individual and remains fairly consistent throughout life.
        <br><br>Personality encompasses all of the thoughts, behavior patterns and social attitudes that impact upon how you view yourself and what you believe about others and the world around you.
        <br><br><br>Knowing more about your personality will help you to understand:
        <br>Your strengths and weaknesses
        <br>Your likes and dislikes
        <br>Which situations allow you to perform at your best
        <br>Other people better

    <tr><th>The Challenges of Self-Awareness and Emotional Intelligence</th></tr>
    <tr><td><img src="challenges.png" alt="The Challenges of Self-Awareness and Emotional Intelligence">
        <br><br><b>Self-Awareness</b> - cornerstone of emotional intelligence
        <br><br>If you are a leader/ coach working with others to help them reach their true potential, you may be surprised at the negative reactions that you encounter from time to time.
        <br><br>Discovering your true authentic self can be a daunting task.
        <br><br>Learning about yourself by increasing your self-awareness is often a difficult process and can be challenging for a variety of reasons.
        <br><br>Human psyche is intricate and multifaceted - understanding your thoughts, emotions and motivations can be challenging due to the the intricacies and depth of the self.
        <br><br>Can be a complex and nuanced process, and so lack of guidance around working with it can be an issue.
        <br><br>Many people struggle to know where to start or how to navigate their inner world effectively.
        <br><br><br><b>Fear of Self-Reflection</b> - some people may have a fear of what they will discover about themselves
        <br><br>Worries that they’ll uncover unpleasant truths or confront difficult emotions
        <br><br>Experiences from the past can lead to emotional trauma that can make it harder for some to access certain parts of their psyche
        <br><br><br><b>Defense Mechanisms</b> - protect themselves from any uncomfortable thoughts and feelings
        <br><br>Includes denial or rationalisation, and being overtly critical of others to place blame upon them
        <br><br><br><b>Lack of Time, Motivation, & Prioritisation</b>  in our fast paced world, many people are constantly busy and may not prioritise self-awareness or self-reflection, feeling that they don’t have the time to engage in introspection
        <br><br>External stimuli, such as technology, work demands and social media can be a more pleasant distraction
        <br><br><br><b>Emotional Avoidance</b> - some people have difficulty dealing with their emotions; they may suppress them or ignore their feelings rather than exploring them
        <br><br><br><b>Ego and Self-Image</b> - a strong ego or attachment to a particular self image can make it challenging to acknowledge and accept aspects of yourself that don’t align with that image
        <br><br>Admitting flaws or vulnerabilities can be difficult for the ego
        <br><br><br><b>Resistance to Change</b> - some people may resist change even if it’s positive because they feel uncomfortable or it’s unfamiliar to them
        <br><br><br><b>Cognitive Biases</b> - such as confirmation bias, seeking information that confirms existing beliefs, or the Dunning-Kruger Effect overestimating one’s abilities, can distort self-perception and hinder self-awareness
        <br><br>Overcoming these challenges often requires patience, practice, and willingness to engage in self exploration
